    <h1>Hot Dog Cookout Calculator</h1>
    <p>
        This program asks you to enter the number of people attending the cookout and the number of hot dogs each person will be given. Then it displays the following details:
        <ul>
            <li>The	minimum	number of packages of hot	dogs required</li>
            <li>The minimum number of packages of hot dog buns required</li>
            <li>The number of hot dogs that will be left over</li>
            <li>The number of hot dog buns that will be left over</li>

        </ul>
         <em>Assume hot dogs come in packages of 10, and hot dog buns come in packages of 8.</em>
        </br></br>
        
        Click on below box to run the program.
