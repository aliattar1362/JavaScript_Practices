        // The month of February normally has 28 days. But if it is a leap year, February has 29 days.  Use the following criteria to identify leap years:
        // 1. Determine whether the year is divisible by 100. If it is, then it is a leap year if and only if it is also divisible by 400. For example, 2000 is a leap year, but 2100 is not.
        // 2. If the year is not divisible by 100, then it is a leap year if and only if it is divisible by 4. For example, 2008 is a leap year, but 2009 is not.
